# Performance-Analysis-of-Popular-Search-Algorithms-using-Java-Python
A comparative study and implementation of popular search algorithms — Linear Search, Binary Search, DFS, BFS &amp; A* — in both Java and Python. This project measures and visualizes execution time, memory usage, and efficiency across datasets of varying sizes to evaluate algorithmic performance and language-level differences.
